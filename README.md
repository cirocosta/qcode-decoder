## Using in your project

Download it as a dependency

```sh
$ bower install qcode-decoder
```

attach it to your `.html` file

```html
<script src="../bower_components/qcode-decoder/build/qcode-decoder.min.js"></script>
```

and use it!

*For more examples, see the [github.io](http://cirocosta.github.io/qcode-decoder/) page and examples folder.*

The API is Pretty simple:

### QCodeDecoder()
Constructor. No args. Might be create with or without `new`.

```javascript
var qr = new QCodeDecoder();
// or
var qr = QCodeDecoder();
```

This construction lets us be able to chain some methods (although not very necessary - the API is **really** simple).

#### ::decodeFromImage(img)

Decodes an image from a source provided or an `<img>` element with a `src` attribute set.

```javascript
qr.decodeFromImage(img, function (err, result) {
  if (err) throw err;

  alert(result);
});
```

#### ::decodeFromVideo(videoElem, cb, [,once])
Decodes directly from a video with a well specified `src` attribute

```javascript
QCodeDecoder()
  .decodeFromVideo(document.querySelector('video'), function (err, result) {
    if (err) throw err;

    alert(result);
  }, true);
```


#### ::decodeFromCamera(videoElem, cb, [,once])
Decodes from a videoElement. The optional argument **once** makes the *QCodeDecoder* to only find a QRCode once.

```javascript
qr.decodeFromCamera(videoElem, function (err) {
  if (err) throw err;

  alert(result);
});
```

#### ::stop()

Stops the current `qr` from searching for a QRCode.


## Messing around

The proper use of camera APIs and, then, the use of this module, the developer needs to first initiate a webserver for running the examples. I suggest going with [http-server](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server).

## Scala.Js wrapper

There is a [wrapper available](https://github.com/mkotsbak/scalajs-qcode-decoder) available for using this library with Scala.Js with a typesafe facade.

## Credits

The main decoder methods are from [Lazar Laszlo](http://www.
lazarsoft.info/), who ported ZXing lib (Apache V2) to JavaScript.
